# Cloud Commander ðŸ¤–

Cloud Commander is a powerful, secure and user-friendly discord bot that lets users manage their AWS resources directly from a discord channel. It is built with Python, Boto3 and Discord.py.

## Features

- Secure IAM Role-based Access via AWS STS
- Region-per-user support (`/set-region`, `/switch-region`)
- EC2 management: list, start, stop, and metrics
- EBS & RDS: volume/status checks, metrics, start/stop RDS
- S3 & Lambda: list buckets/functions, usage stats
- CloudFormation support: list & describe stacks
- CloudWatch metrics
- Network insights: VPCs, Subnets, NACLs, Route Tables and much more

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ bot.py              # Bot logics
â”œâ”€â”€ roles.json          # Stores user-role-region mapping
â”œâ”€â”€ .env               # Contains bot token
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. IAM Role + AWS STS Setup
- Create an IAM role
- Select entity type `AWS Account`
- Name it something like `Awscommander_bot_handle`
- Attach necessary permissions for the services you want to control (It can be done later also).
- Edit Trust Policy and use this
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:user/<your_iam_user_name>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Attach this role to an IAM user (new or exsisting)
- Create an inline policy
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<your_account_id>:role/Awscommander_bot_handle"
    }
  ]
}
```
-Now the IAM user running the bot has permission to call `sts:AssumeRole` on the role we created.

### 2. Configure the Bot

Create a `.env` file and add:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.10+
It is recommended to make a virtual environment and work inside that.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup the bot in the discord server

1. Go to the `#cloud-commander` channel
2. Run `/setup-role <your_iam_role_arn>`
3. Run `/set-region <your_aws_region>` (default: us-east-1)
4. Run `/commands` to explore all supported commands

## How the Bot Interacts with AWS Accounts
- When a user runs a bot command the bot reads the stored IAM role arn from roles.json.
- It uses AWS STS assume_role() to get temporary credentials.
- These credentials are used by boto3 to perform AWS actions on behalf of the user.
- When a user runs a command, the bot looks up their IAM Role and AWS region.
